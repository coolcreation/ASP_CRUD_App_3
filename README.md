When linking a Visual Studio project to a GitHub repository, create the README file in Visual Studio, not Github.
Just create a new 'text' file and rename it `README.md` in the root directory of your project. 
That way your Visual Studio project will have a README file that will be displayed in the GitHub repository.

We need to have a blank Github repository created before we can link it to our Visual Studio project.
Otherwise, we will get an error message when trying to push the project to the repository.
